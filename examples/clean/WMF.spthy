section{* Wide Mouthed Frog *}

text{*
  The protocol is modeled after the description in the SPORE library:

    http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/Software/spore/wideMouthedFrog.html

  Note that we cannot reason about the timestamps in our current model.
  Furthermore, our current calculus for backwards reasoning is too weak
  to reason about the original protocol

    1: I -> S: I, {TimeI, R, kIR}k(I,S)
    2: R <- S:    {TimeS, I, kIR}k(R,S)

  because the server S could receive the message {TimeI, R, kIR}k(I,S)
  arbitrarily many times from himself. Therefore, we added global constants
  identifying the different steps.

protocol WMF
{
  1. I -> S: I,R, {'step1', TimeI, R, kIR}k(I,S)
  2. R <- S: S,I, {'step2', TimeS, I, kIR}k(R,S)
}


subsection{* Secrecy Properties *}

properties (of WMF)
  I_kIR_sec: secret(I, -, kIR, {I,R,S}) 
  S_kIR_sec: secret(S, 1, kIR, {I,R,S}) 
  R_kIR_sec: secret(R, 2, kIR, {I,R,S}) 


subsection{* Authentication Properties *}

text{*
  The authentication guarantee for the initiator is trivial because it does not
  receive any confirmation that the responder received the new session-key.

property (of WMF) S_ni_synch:
