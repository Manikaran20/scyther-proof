Run this protocol with

  scyther-proof --shortest --no-attack-search 

and you'll see that the case of an initiator sending the message expected in
the third step is not considered. This is because

  key = inv(key)

is mistakenly excluded by the occurs check. The Iabelle theory would catch
this, as it implements the occurs check by trying to prove

  |key| /= |inv(key)|

which would fail in this case.
